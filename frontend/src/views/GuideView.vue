        <p class="mb-4"><strong>TO USE TPS, YOU MUST DOWNLOAD THE TPS PACK FROM THE LINK DOWN BELOW.</strong><br/>
            <a href="https://canary.discord.com/channels/859872100860035113/859878646738583553/1204233371077709824"

            <br/>If you are unable to access this link, make sure you are in the Taiko Modding Discord server and have access
            to
            the #mods-and-customs channel. <br/> You can get the invite link at the bottom of this guide.
            <strong>If you are downloading for the first time, use the full download. The quick download is only for
                updating outdated versions!</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-4"><strong>If you don&#39;t want to download the TPS PACK or you don&#39;t want to connect to TPS
            you can setup your
            own local sever using TLS. <br/>Instruction on how to set that up are in the EXTRA section where it says &quot;TLS
            SETUP&quot;.</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-4"><strong>For support with TPS or questions and suggestions join the TPS discord server: </strong>

        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">Installing TPS for the first time:
            Extract TPS.zip into the folder where you extracted CHN. (E.G. C:\TaikoNijiiro)
            When asked to replace files, make sure you choose "REPLACE FILES". If you did not get asked to replace
            files you did something wrong.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Updating TPS to a newer version:
            Follow the same procedures as if you were installing TPS for the first time, this time using the Quick
            Download.
            If the Quick Download is not available or if your version is too old to support the quick download (if the
            date
            of your current version is not between the dates of the updates it contains), use the Full Download instead.
            You will be able to tell if your current version is outdated if the game tells your that you are using an
            outdated client in the song select.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Open config.toml located in Executable\Release_China with notepad and change <strong>server =
            "127.0.0.1"</strong>
            to <strong>server = "tps.keitannunes.ca"</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-4">After you play 1 credit, you can register your card in the WebUI.
